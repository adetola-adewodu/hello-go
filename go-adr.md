### ADR: Using Go as the Preferred Programming Language

## Context

In our organization, we are evaluating programming languages to standardize development efforts across various projects. The objective is to select a language that meets our requirements for performance, scalability, concurrency, ease of deployment, and developer productivity. After assessing multiple languages, including Python, Java, Node.js, and Go, we are considering Go as the preferred language for our future development efforts, particularly for backend services and systems-level programming.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **Go** (Golang) as the preferred programming language for backend development due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming, which aligns with the needs of our projects.

## Rationale

### 1. **Performance and Efficiency**
   - **Go** is a statically typed, compiled language that produces fast executables with minimal memory overhead. Compared to interpreted languages like Python or JavaScript, Go programs have superior runtime performance and are closer to the efficiency of low-level languages like C or C++.
   - The language's garbage collection and memory management system is highly optimized, providing good performance without manual memory management.

### 2. **Concurrency Model**
   - Go has built-in support for concurrency via goroutines and channels, which allows efficient parallel execution of tasks. This makes Go ideal for building high-performance, scalable systems, particularly in environments that require handling multiple simultaneous processes or requests (such as APIs, microservices, or networking applications).
   - Compared to traditional thread-based concurrency models (e.g., in Java or Python), Go's goroutines are lightweight, and the language’s CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) model is simpler and less error-prone.

### 3. **Simplicity and Developer Productivity**
   - Go is known for its simplicity. It has a minimalistic design, with fewer complex features like inheritance, method overloading, or implicit type conversions. This simplicity makes it easier for developers to learn, read, and maintain Go code.
   - The standard library in Go is rich and well-documented, offering strong built-in support for common tasks like HTTP servers, file I/O, cryptography, and JSON handling. This reduces the need for external dependencies and frameworks.
   - **Go modules** have made dependency management simple and effective, reducing the friction of using external packages.

### 4. **Ease of Deployment**
   - Go compiles to a single binary, eliminating the need for complex runtime environments. This makes it easier to build and deploy applications across different environments. The language’s cross-compilation feature allows developers to build executables for different platforms with ease.
   - This ease of deployment is particularly useful in environments where containerization (such as with Docker) and cloud-native architectures are used, as Go applications are lightweight and easy to manage.

### 5. **Ecosystem and Community**
   - Go has a growing and vibrant community with strong support for modern development practices, including cloud-native development, microservices, and DevOps.
   - Many cloud providers and platforms (like Kubernetes, Docker, and Prometheus) are either written in Go or provide strong support for it, making it a well-suited language for modern infrastructure and cloud environments.
   - The Go toolchain includes built-in support for testing and benchmarking, which encourages the development of high-quality, performant code.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Python**: 
   - While Python offers simplicity and developer productivity, it lacks the concurrency and performance characteristics needed for high-performance backend services.
   - Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a bottleneck in multi-threaded applications, especially when scaling.

2. **Java**:
   - Java offers good performance and a mature ecosystem, but it has a more complex concurrency model and longer startup times.
   - Java applications tend to require more resources and are more difficult to deploy compared to Go’s single-binary executables.

3. **Node.js**:
   - Node.js is well-suited for building APIs with JavaScript, but it lacks the concurrency model that Go offers. The single-threaded nature of Node.js can become a bottleneck in CPU-bound tasks, making it less ideal for performance-critical applications.

4. **C++**:
   - While C++ offers fine-grained control over system resources, it comes with increased complexity in memory management and development time.
   - Go provides an excellent balance between performance and simplicity, making it more suited for general backend development.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Improved Performance**: By using Go, we will benefit from better runtime performance and memory efficiency, which is critical for backend services with high traffic or processing needs.
2. **Scalability**: Go's concurrency model allows us to build highly scalable systems that can handle large numbers of concurrent connections, requests, or processes.
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Go’s simple syntax and design will lead to cleaner, more maintainable codebases with less overhead from language features that may be unnecessary for our use cases.
4. **Ease of Deployment**: The ability to compile to a single binary will simplify deployment pipelines, especially in cloud environments where lightweight, portable applications are advantageous.

### Negative Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**: While Go is simple, developers familiar with other languages (e.g., Python, Java) may require time to adapt to Go’s idioms and concurrency model.
2. **Smaller Ecosystem**: Go’s ecosystem, while growing, is not as mature or vast as Java or Python, particularly in specific domains such as data science or machine learning.
3. **Limited Language Features**: Go intentionally avoids some features like generics (although this is changing in newer versions) or complex inheritance, which could be seen as limiting for certain use cases.
4. **Library Support**: Although Go has a strong standard library, there may be fewer third-party libraries compared to languages like Python or Java, especially in niche areas.

## Conclusion

We believe that adopting Go as the preferred language for backend services will improve performance, scalability, and maintainability while simplifying deployments. Its concurrency model and simplicity make it an ideal choice for building modern web services, APIs, and cloud-native applications. Despite some challenges in terms of ecosystem maturity and developer upskilling, the long-term benefits outweigh these concerns. We will move forward with Go as our default language for new projects, while continuing to assess its effectiveness and suitability for different use cases.
